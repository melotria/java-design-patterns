/**
 * The Actor Model is a design pattern used to handle concurrency in a safe, scalable, and
 * message-driven way.
 *
 * <p>In the Actor Model: - An **Actor** is an independent unit that has its own state and behavior.
 * - Actors **communicate only through messages** ‚Äî they do not share memory. - An **ActorSystem**
 * is responsible for creating, starting, and managing the lifecycle of actors. - Messages are
 * delivered asynchronously, and each actor processes them one at a time.
 *
 * <p>üí° Key benefits: - No shared memory = no need for complex thread-safety - Easy to scale with
 * many actors - Suitable for highly concurrent or distributed systems
 *
 * <p>üîç This example demonstrates the Actor Model: - `ActorSystem` starts two actors: `srijan` and
 * `ansh`. - `ExampleActor` and `ExampleActor2` extend the `Actor` class and override the
 * `onReceive()` method to handle messages. - Actors communicate using `send()` to pass `Message`
 * objects that include the message content and sender's ID. - The actors process messages
 * **asynchronously in separate threads**, and we allow a short delay (`Thread.sleep`) to let them
 * run. - The system is shut down gracefully at the end.
